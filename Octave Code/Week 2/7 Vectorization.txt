%Vectorization is the process of taking code that relies on loops and converting it into matrix operations.
%As an example, let's compute our prediction from a hypothesis. Theta is the vector of fields for the hypothesis and x is a vector of variables.

%With loops:
prediction = 0.0;
for j = 1:n+1,
  prediction += theta(j) * x(j);
end;

%With vectorization:
prediction = theta' * x;
